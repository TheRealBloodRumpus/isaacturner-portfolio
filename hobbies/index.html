                <h4>Table Top RPG's</h4>
                <img src="../img/castle.png" alt="Table Top RPG's & Model Castle">
                <p>I love being a player, and I love GM'ing. I usually end up running games because my taste is more old-school, weird, art-punk and gonzo and it seems most people only want to run D&D 5e. That game is fine, I guess... but Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCCRPG) is my jam. Also MÃ–RK BORG, Troika!, Lamentations of the Flame Princess and Electric Bastionland.</p>
                <p><em>Keep it simple, keep it lethal and keep it weird.</em></p>
                <p>Sometimes I build set pieces out of styrofoam and wood. That can really eat up a couple of weekends.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Music</h4>
                <img src="../img/guitars.jpg" alt="Music" style=float:left;>
                <p>I'm a record collector and I'm a big fan of:</p>
                <p>Punk, Dark Hardcore, Death Metal, Black Metal and Grindcore.</p>
                <p>A little bit of Indie, Electronica, Industrial, Shoegaze and Post-Rock.</p>
                <p>Occasionally the weirder side of Hip-Hop.</p>
                <p>And plenty of more mainstream stuff.</p>
                <p>I play guitar, bass, drums and modular synths. I want to be a better drummer. I want to learn to play the piano. I want to play guitar in a crust-punk\death-metal crossover band.</p><p> I want to go on a nature hike with Fenriz from Darkthrone. </p><p>I like explorer-style guitars. I like Peavey and EVH high-gain amps.</p><p>I like to watch Danny Carey play drums.</p><p>I like to watch Terrance Hobbs play guitar.</p>

                <h4>Board Games</h4>
                <img src="../img/board-games.jpeg" alt="board games" style="float:left;">
                <p>I tend to like light to medium weight Euros, but I've been known to burn a whole day on Twilight Imperium or Star Wars Rebellion.</p>
                <p>Currently I'm really digging Inis, Cthulhu Wars, Root, Concordia and Black Angel... and I'm really looking forward to getting On Mars and Dune to the table.</p>
            </div>  
            <div>
                <h4>Mushroom Hunting</h4>
                <img src="../img/isaac-veiledoyster.jpg" alt="Mushroom Hunting" style=float:left;>
                <p>My wife Mika and I forage wild mushrooms. In the past I haven't been much of an outdoors type but something about hunting and identifying fungus really clicked for me. Just finding a mushroom I've never seen before is exciting. Even better when it's food.</p>

                <p>It's given me a much greater appreciation for just being out in the woods. Plus a lot of these things are delicious.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Video Games</h4>
                <img src="../img/videogames.jpg" alt="Video Games" style=float:left;>
                <p>I mostly play indie games on Steam. A lot of Nuclear Throne, Risk of Rain 2, Binding of Isaac, FTL and Into the Breach.</p>
                <p>I like everything Metal Gear. Bayonetta, Death Stranding, Doom, Valkyria Chronicles, Borderlands, Gears of War, Burnout Paradise and Dirt 2.</p>
                <p>I've got a soft spot for the old 16-bit console games like Super Mario World, Super Metroid, A Link to the Past, Sonic the Hedgehog, Toejam and Earl and Kid Chameleon.</p>
                <p>I love the 8-bit era too... the Mario games on the NES, Mega Man, Battletoads, Bubble Bobble and Legend of Zelda.</p>
                <p>I dig the old arcade machines like (fast) Ms. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Centipede, 1943, Metal Slug and Street Fighter.</p>
