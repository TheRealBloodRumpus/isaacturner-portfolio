                <p> On Monster Games' first two self-published titles we found ourselves without an audio designer. So in addition to my programming tasks, I was responsible for all of the sound effects design on these games
                    (engines, exhaust, tire rolls, skids, collisions and UI).</p>
                <p>It was quite challenging as I have no experience or training in this area. Still, as a hobbyist 
                    musician, I know my way around audio tools and 
                    am at least passingly familiar with many of the 
                    core concepts. I'm pretty happy with how these 
                    games sound, all things considered.</p>
                
                <p> On the code side I was responsible for an extensive rewrite of the race-state-driven voice-over system to allow it to act as an announcer or a spotter depending upon the game's needs. I also continued to support the art department with tools for rapid track construction, including a tool for planting randomized signage along arbitrary quartic bezier paths over the terrain.</p>
                <p>These games were built in Unity for PC, PS4, and Xbox One</p>

                <img src="../img/nascar-heat4.jpeg" alt="Nascar Heat 4">
                <p>My primary responsibility for NH4 was the integration of FMOD as our new sound engine. This included writing a wrapper over the FMOD API to allow it to easily plug into our existing audio calls. I also supported
                    the audio designer with features and tools and worked with Javascript in the FMOD Studio Editor scripting environment.</p> 
                <p>I also supported the art department with tools, including a fence builder that allows the track artists to easily place customizable fences that follow the contour of the terrain.</p> 
                 <p>This game was built in Unity for PC, PS4, and Xbox One</p>

                <p>With the Nintendo decade at Monster Games having come to a close in 2015, these two games marked the end of
                my tenure as a level designer and my return to programming full time. </p> 
                <p>Nascar Heat Evolution was my first exposure to Unity, the C# language, and shader programming. I wrote the vehicle damage system (that crumples the vehicle mesh
                in a collision) and collaborated on the design and implementation of our new UI system, among other things.</p>
                 <p>These games were built in Unity for PC, PS4, and Xbox One</p>

                <h4>Xenoblade Chronicles</h4>  <!--Xenoblade Chronicles-->
                <img src="../img/xenoblade-box.jpg" alt="Xenoblade Chronicles">
                <p>It's incredible to have my name associated with Xenoblade, even in some small way. 
                It's one of the best JRPGs I've ever played. There was little to no game design on this title 
                (it was a straight port to 3DS), but the dual-screen nature of the target platform meant an 
                extensive redesign of the UI and seeing as how this is a fairly traditional RPG, there was a ton of work to be done.</p>
                <p>I was involved in much of the redesign.  However, my primary responsibility was writing a UI editor in Java for the team to use. 
                It was slick and powerful and one of the things I'm most proud of over my career so far.

                <h4>Donkey Kong Country Returns: Tropical Freeze</h4><!--Donkey Kong Country Returns: Tropical Freeze-->
                <img src="../img/dkcr-tropicalfreeze.jpg" alt="Donkey Kong Country Returns: Tropical Freeze">
                <p>After our success designing new levels for the 3DS port of Donkey Kong Country Returns, we collaborated with Retro Studios
                to help them finish Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze for the Wii U.</p>
                <p>The design team at Monster Games spent about a month and a half at Retro Studios in Austin Texas. We learned their new  tools for DKCR:TF level design. </p><p>It was pretty intense, but also super fun and satisfying. I also found that I don't mind working off-site for an extended period of time if needed.</p>

                <h5>3-2 Baobab Bonanza</h5>
                <p class="one">Baobab Bonanza was an intriguing level to work on. The core gimmicks came as a (somewhat) vague request from Nintendo: 
                    rolling nuts and "tippy flower platforms." I'm particularly proud of the giant nut set-piece at the end of the level.

                <h5>4-6 Current Capers</h5>
                <p class="one">Current Capers was a collaborative effort on the part of the whole MGI design team. I designed the electrified tentacles 
                and several of the rooms and sequences in this level.</p>

                <h5>4-K Spinning Spines</h5>
                <p class="one">Spinning Spines was my first level for DKCR: Tropical Freeze. I think the giant spinning cylinders are cool, and getting 
                blasted down the center of the big one into the lava pools is pretty exciting!</p>

                <h5>7-3 Crazy Clouds</h5>
                <p class="one">Of all the levels I've designed, I think I'm the proudest of this one. We were under the gun at the end of the project, and my colleague Todd and I managed to put this level together in record time...
                and it turned out to be one of our best!</p>

                <p>DKCR3D was the first really big-name game I worked on. It was a port of the Wii version of Donkey Kong Country Returns to the Nintendo 3DS platform. </p><p>I was
                on the design team for this one. We added a new 9th world with eight new levels and redesigned the UI to work on the 3DS' dual screens.</p>

                <h5>9-1 Crushing Columns</h5>
                <p class="one"> Monster Games' first Donkey Kong level. Crushing Columns was a collaborative effort with one of the other designers. I'm very proud of the primary gimmick (the tracked platform that tips right and left) and the sequence at the end where the columns come crashing down on the platforms.</p>

                <h5>9-5 Topsy Turvy</h5>
                <p class="one">This is a great level, however it's not my design. I was responsible for
                    the complex network of metronomes and reset logic that keeps all of the
                    moving platforms in lock-step with the beat of the music.

                <p>Pilot Wings Resort was a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was fantastic to get to use
                the 3DS prototype hardware before Nintendo even announced the system. I designed around 1/3 of the levels for this game and worked on UI design as well.</p>

                <p>ExciteBike World Rally was a downloadable game for Nintendo WiiWare. It is essentially a reboot of the original Excitebike with all new levels, many of which I designed.</p><p>
                This game was so much fun to work on because I still have vivid memories of playing the Excitebike arcade machine at a local pizza joint when I was a little kid.</p><p>
                The environments are based on the worlds from Excite Truck and Excitebots, but the game is pure, old-school Excitebike.</p>

                <p>What a totally bizarre game this is. Animal shaped vehicles that turn into robots, huge air, crazy tricks, weird in-race minigames, a high-speed multiplayer poker game, unlockable costumes for the vehicles...designing levels for this game was super fun and kinda surreal.</p>

                <p>This was my first project at Monster Games, and the first of many Nintendo games I worked on. I joined the team near the end of this project so my design contributions
                are minimal (rings and token placement) but I did a lot of QA work on this one.</p>

                <p>What started as my first Unity experiment ended up turning into an actual product with some friends' help. An old-school arcade-inspired shooter with juicy pixel art for mobile (iOS, Android).</p> 
                <p> We finished it, and it was available on the mobile stores for a while, but since we are pretty clueless about marketing and advertising, it just kinda
                    fizzled out.</p>
